# Introduction
As one of the most prevalent mental illnesses today, depression affects a large number of people worldwide and is regarded as a primary care illness. According to research, one-third of American adults will experience depression at some point in their lives. The World Health Organization estimates that 350 million individuals worldwide suffer from depression. According to statistics from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) study conducted between 2005 and 2008, the prevalence of severe depression and depressive symptoms was 0.6% and 22, respectively.

Studies on the relationship between caffeine use and depression symptoms have been conducted recently. In terms of diet-related variables, coffee was discovered to be among the most consumed beverages globally. Caffeine use has been shown in several epidemiological studies to provide protection against cognitive decline or impairment. Caffeine and glucose together have been shown in another investigation to improve the attentional system's effectiveness. It has been determined that caffeine affects depression.

Prior research on this matter has failed to produce a consensus. Caffeine-induced A2AR blockage has a therapeutic impact on depression, according to an animal study that investigated the causal relationship between caffeine consumption and depressive-like mood abnormalities. In US adults, there is a negative correlation between caffeine use and depressed symptoms, according to a study based on NHANES data from 2005 to 2006. A related study that involved 9,576 people in Korea provided support for this investigation. In 2021, a second case-control research discovered a link between children's depression and caffeine. Nevertheless, the samples from this earlier research were either too old or not nationally representative, making them unrepresentative of the current situation. Most notably, in the earlier study, there was less worry about the association's possible threshold impact. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between caffeine use and depression using data from the NHANES 2017â€“2018 database.
