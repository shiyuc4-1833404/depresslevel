# Introduction
As one of the most prevalent mental illnesses today, depression affects a large number of people worldwide and is regarded as a primary care illness. According to research, one-third of American adults will experience depression at some point in their lives. The World Health Organization estimates that 350 million individuals worldwide suffer from depression. According to statistics from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) study conducted between 2005 and 2008, the prevalence of severe depression and depressive symptoms was 0.6% and 22, respectively.

Studies on the relationship between caffeine use and depression symptoms have been conducted recently. In terms of diet-related variables, coffee was discovered to be among the most consumed beverages globally. Caffeine use has been shown in several epidemiological studies to provide protection against cognitive decline or impairment. It has been determined that caffeine affects depression. However, prior research on this matter has failed to produce a consensus. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to further investigate the relationship between caffeine use and depression using data from the NHANES 2017–2020 database.

Motivating by caffeine consumption, we also want to know if there are other factors affecting depression and if they affect depression more than caffeine consumption. The phrase depression level always appears with factors such as age, gender, income, and race. Thus, besides caffeine consumption, we included the data of these four variables from the NHANES 2017–2020 database as well to find their relationship with depression level.
