### Description
The purpose of our study is to investigate the relationship between depression level and caffeine consumption, age, income, gender, and race. Recognizing depression as a prevalent global mental illness affecting a significant population, we aim to contribute valuable insights into potential preventive measures.
We seek to understand how variations in gender and race, coupled with factors like increasing caffeine consumption, age, and specific income levels, can influence or mitigate the likelihood of depression. This research is motivated by the need to address conflicting findings in prior studies and to provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between those elements and mental health.
Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to the existing knowledge base and inform discussions around lifestyle factors and mental well-being.
