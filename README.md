### Description
The purpose of our study is to investigate the relationship between caffeine consumption and depression. Recognizing depression as a prevalent global mental illness affecting a significant population, we aim to contribute valuable insights into potential preventive measures. 
We seek to understand how increased coffee consumption within a specific range may influence or mitigate the risk of depression. This research is motivated by the need to address conflicting findings in prior studies and to provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between caffeine and mental health. 
Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to the existing knowledge base and inform discussions around lifestyle factors and mental well-being.
